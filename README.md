### About me

My name is Jez. In Spring 2024, I made a decision to train as a Java developer. As I came to the end of a degree in Mathematics, I needed a new technical challenge and, from previous experience, software development seemed the perfect fit. I decided to take the plunge and have not once looked back. Fast-forward to the present day and I am in the final project stage of a 13-week full-time bootcamp-style course in Java development, curated and led by the team at Northcoders from their Manchester office. I have covered so much ground and learnt so much; it would mean so much to find an opportunity to embed those skills in a professional context. If you need a candidate with a strong background in Object-Oriented Programming and experience building fully-fledged Java applications using Spring for HTTP backends and Android for frontends, I might just be your man.

### What I do

I have full-stack experience. My primary language is Java but I have worked with JavaScript and Python. I have structured RESTful APIs within the Spring Framework, relying on JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration testing. I have deployed applications to a remote database instance hosted within AWS, containerised with Docker, and implemented the Elastic Beanstalk management tool to address issues of load balancing and scalability.

At the frontend, I have been working within Android Studio to craft an engaging UI experience allowing users a means to access the API directly. Adhering to the MVVM architectural pattern, I have implemented the Retrofit dependency to manage client-side requests to the API, the RecyclerView library for efficient View caching leading to benefits in performance and power consumption, and the Parcelable interface for more efficient serialisation and transmission of data between activities with intents. Within activities themselves, I continually adjust the XML resource layout files to give a clean and intuitive presentation that allows the users to navigate the API seamlessly.

Transitioning to the backend, I have sought to hone my skills in database design building familiarity with PostgreSQL, via pgAdmin or the psql CLI. To that end, I have experimented with two approaches; first working at a low-level via the JDBC API building discrete queries in SQL, and secondly entrusting object mapping to Hibernate within the significantly-abstracted Spring Data JPA.
