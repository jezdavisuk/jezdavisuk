I am coming to the end of a 13-week full-time bootcamp-style course in Java development, curated and led by the team at Northcoders from their Manchester office. 

There would be no higher goal than to apply what I have learnt in a professional context. If you need a candidate with a strong background in Object-Oriented Programming and experience building fully-fledged Java applications using Spring for HTTP backends and Android for frontends, I might just be your man.

I'm currently working to develop an application that teaches children in the UK how to use a Japanese Soroban abacus. The objective is to create a free resource that gives students the chance to practise basic mental arithmetic.
